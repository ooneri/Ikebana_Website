Analysing the founding concepts of the research of della Valle (in particular of <em>\"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://martinadellavalle.info/wabisabi\">Wabi-Sabi</a>\"</em>), themes such as the study of marginal and refusal areas on the landscape, the traces of the human intervention on the urban vegetation, the value of the concept of time and emptiness and the capacity of Ikebana (as also of the photographic medium) to exalt through a process of de-contextualization. After a brief introduction about origins and principles of the art of Ikebana, the research takes place on the surrounding vegetal landscape, walking to select the vegetal spontaneous materials (plants, flowers, branches..). After that, guided by the ikebana teacher, the participants will create their own Ikebana arrangement. The photographic documentation of the resulting creations, will build up an ideal portrait of the natural native landscape mapping the specific working area.",
